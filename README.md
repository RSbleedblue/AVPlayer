- Visualize audio signal as the recording plays

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Lucide React**: For icons used in play/pause controls.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **Recharts**: For visualizing audio data as a line chart.
- **Context API**: For managing the state of the application.
